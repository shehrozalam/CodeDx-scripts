This is a repository for some CodeDx scripts to automate the workflow for a CI/CD Pipeline.
The usage of the script is pretty straightforward. You use it like this:
./RunAnalysis.sh --user <your username or just use env var> --pass <your password or just use ENV var> --cdx-url <url for your codedx instance> --project-id <project id for your project>
